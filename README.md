#What is this project?
I am trying to automate my uni's printer's job by wrapping it in a server-client. How is it different from a printer shared on a local network, well, I am going to connect it to the internet.

#Motivation behind this project
The primary motivation behind building this project is to make things easier for people because right now the way things are, I dont like them, infact i think nobody likes them, so how about a sweet little automation. I also wanted to created something useful. Also, I wanted to learn Go because I like to learn new stuff and because why not.Lets efing Go(pun intended). Other reason could be selling this project to the printer guy for some extra cash(he doesnt know about open source). I mean who can say no to that money right?

#Implementation plan
None. I simply dont have a plan. I am just gonna figure things out as I go about building this project.

#Security risks I should be aware of
I guess we'll find out.
